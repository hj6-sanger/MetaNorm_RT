# Analysis of somatic retrotranspositions in the MetaNorm project

Welcome to this site. This site will serve as a source code repository for analyzing somatic retrotranspositions in non-neoplastic genomes.

Here, we analyzed 9,829 non-neoplastic samples of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data from 337 donors across 28 tissue types, encompassing a wide range of tissue types, including tissues with normal or abnormal conditions

# Codes


1. The code to generate a phylogenetic tree can be found at https://github.com/nataliabrz/liver_ndp_tree_building. This code was used to generate the phylogenetic tree in Fig. 2 and Figs. 3b-3e.
