# Analysis of somatic retrotranspositions in the MetaNorm project

Welcome to this site. This site will serve as a source code repository for analyzing somatic retrotranspositions in non-neoplastic genomes.

Here, we analyzed 9,829 non-neoplastic samples of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data from 337 donors across 28 tissue types, encompassing a wide range of tissue types, including tissues with normal or abnormal conditions


1. "/Analysis/" contains scripts for analyzing age with dnSVs, phasing analysis, timing of triplications from maternal origin, and analyzing genomic properties.

2. "/Filtering/" contains scripts for filtering out SVs.
